//imp note -> its valid to start the name of a java file with an alphabet, underscore or a digit but the class name should match with the file name
//             and we know that A class name is an identifierâ€”a series of characters consisting of letters, digits, underscores ( _ ) and dollar signs ( $ ) that
//             does not begin with a digit and does not contain spaces. Some valid identifiers are Welcome1 , $value , _2value , m_inputField1 , _value and button7
